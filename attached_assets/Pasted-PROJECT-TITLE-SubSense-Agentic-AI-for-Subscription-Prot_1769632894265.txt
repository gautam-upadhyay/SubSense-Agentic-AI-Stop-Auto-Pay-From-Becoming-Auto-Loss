PROJECT TITLE

SubSense – Agentic AI for Subscription Protection

ROLE

You are a senior full-stack FinTech engineer and AI architect building a production-grade, hackathon-winning application.

GOAL

Build a Paytm / Google Pay–style FinTech web application that protects users from silent financial losses caused by auto-pay subscriptions, using a real Agentic AI system with human-in-the-loop safety.

The project must:

Run cleanly in VS Code

Be easy to explain to judges

Use modern, industry-grade tech

Have clear agent orchestration

Look polished and professional

🔐 CORE PRODUCT PROMISE

SubSense detects risky subscription patterns early, quantifies exact monetary loss, explains the risk in human language, and allows users to decide—never executing financial actions without explicit user consent.

🧩 CORE USE CASES TO IMPLEMENT (MANDATORY)
1️⃣ Forgotten Free Trial → Auto-Pay Protection

Detect trial → paid conversion

Show “Trial ending in X days”

Pre-billing reminder (24–48 hrs)

Loss calculation (monthly + yearly)

Actions: Continue / Pause / Cancel

2️⃣ Subscription Price Increase Detection

Compare historical vs current price

Detect % increase (configurable threshold)

Project yearly loss

Actions: Keep / Cancel Auto-Pay

3️⃣ Unused Digital Subscriptions

Detect inactivity (30 / 60 / 90 days)

Show usage timeline

Loss calculation

Actions: Continue / Pause / Cancel

4️⃣ Offline Memberships (Gym / Classes)

Detect recurring offline payments

Estimate attendance patterns

Seasonal usage awareness

Loss calculation

Actions: Continue / Pause / Cancel

🟢 ADDITIONAL HIGH-IMPACT CASES
5️⃣ Duplicate / Overlapping Subscriptions

Category grouping

Side-by-side comparison

“Keep One” recommendation

6️⃣ Small Charges That Add Up

Aggregate low-value subscriptions

Show hidden yearly cost

7️⃣ Upcoming Auto-Renewal (Annual Plans)

Renewal countdown

Early cancel option

8️⃣ Premium Plan Overpayment

Feature usage estimation

Downgrade simulation

🌟 CROSS-CUTTING PRODUCT FEATURES

Smart notification control (severity-based)

Monthly + yearly loss everywhere

“Why am I seeing this?” explanation

No automatic cancellations

Full audit trail

Learns user preferences over time

🏗️ REQUIRED TECH STACK (STRICT)
🔹 Frontend

React + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui

Wouter (routing)

TanStack React Query

Recharts

Lucide React + react-icons

Light/Dark Mode

UI inspired by Paytm / GPay / PhonePe / Stripe dashboards

UI must look modern, minimal, fintech-grade, not a toy project.

🔹 Backend

Node.js

Express 5

TypeScript (ESM)

Zod validation

REST APIs

Clean logs visible in terminal

🔹 Database

SQLite

Drizzle ORM

Type-safe schema

Seed scripts with realistic data

Easy upgrade path to PostgreSQL

🔹 Agentic AI Layer (MOST IMPORTANT)

Use REAL agent frameworks, not fake logic.

AI Stack

LangChain (LLM interface + tools)

LangGraph (agent orchestration)

CrewAI (multi-agent roles)

OpenAI / Claude API

Low-temperature prompts for deterministic finance reasoning

Agents to Implement

Monitoring Agent

Anomaly Detection Agent

Usage Analysis Agent

Risk Prediction Agent

Reasoning Agent (natural-language explanation)

Action Recommendation Agent (never auto-executes)

Orchestration Flow
DB → Monitor → Detect → Predict → Explain → Recommend → User

🔹 Human-in-the-Loop Safety (MANDATORY)

AI only recommends

User must approve every action

Confirmation modals

DB audit logs

No autonomous execution

🔧 AI TOOLS (LANGCHAIN)

Implement tools for:

Fetching subscriptions

Fetching transactions

Calculating loss

Updating subscription state (only after approval)

AI must only operate through tools, never hallucinate data.

UI alert updates

🧑‍⚖️ JUDGE-FRIENDLY PRINCIPLES

Explainability > hype

Transparency > automation

Safety > autonomy

User control always

🎯 FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Generate:

Full working codebase

Clean UI similar to Paytm / GPay

Real Agentic AI (LangChain + LangGraph + CrewAI)

SQLite + Drizzle integration

Ready to export to VS Code

Hackathon-winning quality

DO NOT

Auto-cancel subscriptions

Hide logic in prompts

Use fake “AI” if/else only

Overcomplicate UX
