You are a senior FinTech engineer + Agentic AI architect building a realistic UPI-style payment and auto-pay subscription system for a hackathon demo.

This system must simulate real-world payments in real time, including QR scanning from a mobile phone, but must not process real money.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Extend SubSense – Agentic AI for Subscription Protection with a real-time payment simulation layer that:

Looks and behaves like Paytm / GPay / PhonePe

Allows users to:

Select subscription platforms (Netflix, Prime, AWS, Gym, Apple TV, etc.)

Pay via QR code / UPI / Card (simulated)

Create auto-pay subscriptions

Instantly reflects transactions in SubSense

Triggers AI agents automatically

Is clearly marked as “Demo / Sandbox Mode”

🧩 CORE FEATURES TO BUILD
1️⃣ Subscription Marketplace (Sidebar)

Create a sidebar with popular Indian & global platforms:

Netflix

Amazon Prime

AWS

Apple TV

Spotify

Gym / Coaching

Cloud Services

Education Platforms

Each platform must have:

Logo

Monthly / yearly plan

Auto-pay enabled by default

2️⃣ Payment Page (Paytm / GPay Style UI)

When user clicks a platform:

Redirect to /pay/:platform

Show:

Platform name & logo

Amount

Payment methods:

UPI

QR Code

Debit / Credit Card (dummy)

“Proceed to Pay” button

3️⃣ REAL-TIME QR PAYMENT SIMULATION (CRITICAL)
QR Code Behavior

Generate a dynamic QR code that encodes:

transactionId

amount

platform

QR must be scannable by any phone camera

Phone Flow

Scanning QR opens a mobile-friendly demo page

Page mimics UPI app UI:

“Pay ₹XXX to SubSense”

Confirm button

On confirm:

Call backend webhook

Mark payment as SUCCESS

⚠️ Clearly show:

“Demo Payment – No real money involved”

4️⃣ Backend Payment Engine (Simulated Gateway)

Create a dummy payment gateway service:

POST /api/payments/initiate

POST /api/payments/confirm

POST /api/payments/webhook

Logic:

Simulate processing delay (1–2 sec)

Mark transaction SUCCESS

Store transaction in DB

Create auto-pay subscription

Update wallet balance

5️⃣ Auto-Pay Subscription Creation

After payment success:

Create subscription entry:

platform

amount

billing cycle

next charge date

Mark as AUTO_PAY_ACTIVE

6️⃣ Real-Time Updates (Very Important)

Use polling or WebSockets so that:

Payment confirmation appears instantly

Subscription appears instantly

Transaction list updates live

🗄️ DATABASE REQUIREMENTS (SQLite + Drizzle)

Tables:

wallet

transactions

subscriptions

autopay_rules

audit_logs

All actions must be stored.

🤖 AGENTIC AI INTEGRATION

After every payment or auto-pay creation:

Trigger LangGraph agent flow:

Monitor → Detect → Predict → Explain → Recommend


Agents must:

Observe new subscription

Calculate monthly & yearly loss

Detect risky patterns later

Generate explanations

🧠 HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP SAFETY

AI must NEVER auto-cancel or auto-pay

All actions require user confirmation

Show confirmation modals

Log all actions

🎨 UI REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)

UI must resemble:

Paytm

Google Pay

PhonePe

Stripe dashboards

Use:

React + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui

Smooth transitions

Clear success / failure screens

🧑‍⚖️ JUDGE TRANSPARENCY (MANDATORY)

Every payment screen must display:

“Sandbox / Demo Mode – No real money is transferred”

🎥 DEMO EXPECTATION

User scans QR using real phone

Confirms payment

SubSense updates instantly

Auto-pay subscription created

AI reacts later

❌ DO NOT

Use real payment gateways

Claim real UPI integration
