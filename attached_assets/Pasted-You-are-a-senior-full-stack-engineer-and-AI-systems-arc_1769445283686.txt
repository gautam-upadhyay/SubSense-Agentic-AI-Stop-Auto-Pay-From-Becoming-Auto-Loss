You are a senior full-stack engineer and AI systems architect building a realistic, hackathon-ready FinTech web application called:

SubSense – Agentic AI for Subscription Protection
🎯 Project Objective

Build a Paytm / GPay–style payment dashboard that simulates wallet transactions and auto-pay subscriptions, augmented with an Agentic AI system that autonomously protects users from silent financial loss.

The system must detect:

Silent subscription price increases

Unused or forgotten subscriptions

Recurring long-term financial leakage

The AI must operate using a true agentic loop:

Observe → Reason → Decide → Act,
while ensuring user approval before any action.

🧱 Technology Stack (MANDATORY – DO NOT CHANGE)
Frontend

React.js

Tailwind CSS

Chart.js or Recharts

Backend

Node.js with Express (primary application backend)

Python with FastAPI (Agentic AI microservice)

Database

SQLite (preferred)

JSON allowed for mock data where simpler

AI & Reasoning

Deterministic, rule-based logic for detection

OpenAI GPT only for:

Explanation

Risk reasoning

Human-readable alerts

No hallucinated actions or decisions

🧩 System Architecture (REALISTIC & MODULAR)
1️⃣ Frontend (React Web App)

Build a clean, modern UPI-style payment interface with:

Wallet balance overview

Auto-pay subscriptions list

Transaction history

AI alerts dashboard

User actions:

Cancel subscription

Keep subscription

View AI explanation

2️⃣ Backend (Node.js – Payment Simulation Engine)

Responsibilities:

Simulate wallet balance and transactions

Simulate monthly auto-pay deductions

Store transactions and subscriptions

Emit events when a new transaction occurs

Communicate with the AI service for analysis

This backend represents a realistic payment ledger, not a toy example.

3️⃣ Agentic AI Service (Python – FastAPI)

Implement autonomous AI agents, each with a clear responsibility:

🟦 Monitoring Agent

Observes new transactions

Identifies recurring payments

Builds subscription memory over time

🟥 Anomaly Detection Agent

Detects price increases >15%

Identifies trial-to-paid transitions

Flags plan drift without user action

🟨 Usage Analysis Agent

Analyzes service usage frequency

Detects unused subscriptions over time

🟪 Risk Prediction Agent

Estimates monthly and yearly financial loss

Assigns risk levels:

High

Medium

Low

🟩 Reasoning Agent (LLM-assisted)

Explains:

What changed

Why it matters

Financial impact

Uses GPT only for explanation, not decisions

🟧 Action Recommendation Agent

Suggests:

Cancel auto-pay

Keep subscription

Executes action only after user approval

🔄 Functional Flow (STRICT – MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)

Auto-pay transaction occurs

Transaction is stored in backend

Agentic AI observes the transaction

AI reasons using historical context

Decision point:

If no anomaly → continue silent monitoring

If anomaly detected:

Analyze risk & projected loss

Generate explainable alert

Request user action

User decision:

Cancel → disable auto-pay

Keep → continue monitoring

This loop must run continuously and autonomously.

📊 Data Models (REALISTIC)
Subscription

merchant

current_amount

billing_cycle (monthly / yearly)

status (active / paused / cancelled)

last_used_date

Transaction

date

merchant

amount

transaction_type (AUTO_PAY / MANUAL)

status (success / blocked)

Data should resemble real bank statements, not random numbers.

🎨 UI & UX REQUIREMENTS

Professional FinTech-style UI

Risk badges (High / Medium / Low)

Alerts must clearly explain:

What changed

Why it is risky

Estimated yearly loss

One-click, simulated actions

No clutter, demo-first layout

🧠 Agentic AI REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)

Autonomous operation (no manual triggers)

Clear separation of agents

Persistent memory of past transactions

Deterministic logic for detection

GPT used only for explanation and reasoning

No hallucinated financial actions

🧪 Hackathon Constraints

No real banking or UPI APIs

No real payments

Fully simulated but realistic

Must run fully in browser

Demo-ready in one click

📁 Deliverables

Fully working React frontend

Node.js backend APIs

Python FastAPI AI service

Clean folder structure

README including:

Setup instructions

Demo walkthrough

Architecture explanation

Agent roles

🏆 Quality Expectations

Clean, modular code

Professional naming conventions

Clear comments

Minimal but impactful features

Strong focus on agentic AI behavior

🚨 Important Constraints

Do NOT over-engineer

Do NOT use real financial APIs

Prioritize:

Realism

Explainability

Demo clarity

Agentic decision-making
